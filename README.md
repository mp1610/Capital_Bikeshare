# Capital_Bikeshare

This is my first ever data science project.
I made use of Tidyverse Packages within RStudio to carry out data cleaning, handling, manipulation, and visualisations to analyse a large dataset.
The raw data has been obtained from the Capital Bikeshare website (https://capitalbikeshare.com) as it is openly accessible information. Under the ‘system data’ section of the website, Capital Bikeshare provide trip history data, real-time data, expansion plan data, and results of member surveys conducted.
The datasets used for this project are 'bikeshare_locations' & 'rides_2019_2020_extract' both of which can be found on the Capital Bikeshare website.

The goal of this project was to look at the raw data, and obtain 5 interesting research questions (descriptive & exploratory) which can be answered through the data.
The operationalised research questions are answered by making use of a clean dataset to create several meaningful visualisations which support any evaluations made.

Note: The 'rides_2019_2020_extract' dataset is also used in this project, however cannot be uploaded onto Github due to its size. To run the R code for this project, ensure this dataset is obtained and saved into the 'data' folder. Else, view the html file created which is the final output for the project.
